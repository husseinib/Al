<strong>The Sabian homeland</strong><br>
“The original inhabitants are the Houeiza tribe. The people who lived in Qalat Saleh were from the Sabi’ah tribe, who lived in the Al-Kassarah area between Qalat Saleh and Al-Azair. Qalat Saleh became the nucleus city. The Sabians were craftsmen. The Ottoman government brought them from the Al-Kassarah area to Qalat Saleh and settled them on the left bank of the Tigris River, in an area known as Akouf. This information became known to others, and we call it the Tijara Street or Market Street. There was a river called the Qarma River, which connected between the Tigris River and the Materyil River to the eastern marshes. They lived on the left bank of the Qarma River and the Tigris River in a triangular area because their nature was related to water, and places of worship and rituals had to be connected to water. …Qalat Saleh is the capital of Mandaeism and the evidence is the presence of two monasteries that do not exist in other areas of Iraq.” (Voices from Amara)

<strong>God’s Kindness</strong><br>
“It's a testament to God's kindness that creation isn't confined to any particular sect or class. Iraq takes pride in individuals like Abdul Jabbar Abdullah, a renowned physicist honoured worldwide, even gifted a personal pen by Einstein for his excellence. Maysan cherishes him as one of their own, a sentiment shared by Qal'at Salih, his hometown. Entrusted by Abdul Karim Qasim to lead Baghdad University, Abdullah aimed to foster genuine intellectual growth, but his efforts were thwarted by senseless acts. Despite his untimely passing, his potential loss is deeply felt. Similarly, Abdul Razzaq Abdul Wahid, a towering figure in vertical poetry, leaves an indelible mark. Al-Jawahiri once beautifully symbolized Iraqi poetry's essence, citing Amara and Basra, representing Abdul Razzaq Abdul Wahid and Al-Sayyab, respectively. Lamia’a Abbas Amara, a celebrated poetess known for her warmth, alongside numerous Sabian contributors, further enrich Iraq's literary landscape. Noteworthy is the jeweler Zahroun, whose mastery astonished even when using simpler tools. These individuals, with their talents and contributions, stand ready to serve their country whenever the opportunity arises.” (Voices from Masan)
