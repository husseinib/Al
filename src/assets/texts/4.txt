<strong>Special Rituals</strong><br>
“They would have separate wedding traditions from Muslims in the town. In Mandaean weddings, they would take the bride in winter or summer and immerse her in a well in the morning before the wedding ceremony, which was a ritual unknown to the Muslims.” (Voices from Amara)

<strong>Wedding Traditions</strong><br>
“For weddings, many cars would come, and they would call it the Mandi, which was like a
forest with trees. They would bring the bride and cover the water well with about seven
covers. I saw it with my own eyes. We used to spy on them as they entered the canal, and
their Sheikh would marry them.” (Voices from Amara)

<strong>Present since ancient times</strong><br>
“This brotherhood, this country, this region, all these matters mean that they need to be practically employed in the subject of dealing with religions, and the Sabians are a key component in Iraq, especially in Maysan province. They have a strong relationship with water and Maysan, this is a well-known historical fact, they have been present since ancient times, practicing their beliefs on the banks of the rivers in Maysan, as well as in Thi Qar and Basra, and in some areas of Iran. This is their historical presence in reality.” (Voices from Maysan)
