<strong>The Sabians' connection to water is divine</strong><br>
“It is divine wisdom that water is the essence of everything. Water revitalizes and sustains life for humans and all creations. It is a fundamental component, both physically and spiritually, permeating every aspect of life. Just as science evolves with society, divine wisdom continually introduces new elements to complement existing ones. Integration, as mentioned by Sabians, Jews, and Christians, in Islam signifies integration with the noble Prophet, peace be upon him and his family. A complete individual requires comprehensive knowledge and a harmonious household to thrive in a society that embraces integration. May we achieve such unity in the end journey of life, by the will of God.” (Voices from Maysan)
