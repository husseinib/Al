<strong>‘Builders of Iraq’</strong><br>"The Sabaeans are the foundation of Iraq; they are among the ones who built Iraq 4000 years ago. They are the fundamental roots of Iraq, as is the case with the Assyrians and Chaldeans. The Sabaeans revere water, as is the case in all religions, including Islam, due to the significant role of water in creation, as mentioned in the Holy Quran: \'And We created from water every living thing.\' …I am deeply sorry for their migrated, as they are partners in the homeland, city, school, and lifelong companions." (Voices from Amara)<br><br><strong>‘Respect & Peace’</strong><br>"When we were young, during the monarchy era, we didn\'t understand matters of religions and sects. One day, one of the elders of the area approached us and informed us that the Mandaeans worship by the river. He advised us not to go to the river during their holidays so as not to disturb them with our presence nearby. We respected this and gave them their space to enjoy peace and continue their worship." (Voices from Nassiryah)
