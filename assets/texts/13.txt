Making a beautiful fabric of the city
"Frankly, I remembered many beautiful things, to the extent that you can see the smile drawn on my face, when we used to play and have fun, when we used to go to the river bank near Mandi's place when we used to greet each other, joke around, and share joy and sorrow, and we didn't know the meaning of being a Sabi, Muslim, or Christian; we were making a beautiful fabric of the city. …"A simple park has been established in a small area near the Nasiriya Mandi, and it has become a gathering place for all segments of the Iraqi people. If a park or a flower can bring together our scattered pieces, then what memories of life, childhood, lineage, school, and neighbours can do? …My feeling when my Mandean friends emigrated is like the feeling of losing a limb from one's body, like losing a hand or a foot. That's how I felt when they left. I used to share my life with them in all its details, only for them to disappear overnight." (Voices from Nassiryah) 

Indistinguishable
"I couldn't distinguish them in the city of Rifai where we shared the same style of clothing. They were brought up well, and they were characterized by high morals. They were very sociable, interacting with people during their occasions, and when they passed by us, they greeted us in the Islamic way without any discrimination." (Voices from Nassiryah)
