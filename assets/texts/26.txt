A Breeze in the City
“I didn't realize they were Mandaeans until later. They were like a breeze in the city, honest, and trustworthy, and people bought from them without fear of being cheated. They belonged to one of the wonderful families in the city and were a pillar of strength in the community. …"It was the custom of the city that a funeral procession would pass through the main market. So, the Sabians would close their shops and stand in respect for the deceased. This noble
gesture also occurred during religious occasions such as Ashura and others. Therefore, we do not feel that there is any difference between us. …"When the Sabian friends informed us of their departure, I went with all members of my family to their house. It was one of the hardest and most sorrowful times for me, as I returned home unconscious due to the intensity of sadness and tears streaming from my eyes. Up until this moment, whenever I remember them, I feel sadness, and the voices of their children ring in my ears, as I used to see them daily, and if I was absent for a day, their children would come to my house and ask me about the reason for my absence, saying, 'Grandma, why didn't you visit us today?' We were just like a single family." (Voices from Nassiryah)

This is how we are as a society
“When a material is made of a single component, it becomes fragile and prone to breaking. Just like pure gold lacks the strength and durability of alloys, so do other natural materials like wood, iron, and stone without additives. This fragility mirrors our societal nature, as intended by the Lord. We don’t require rigid categorizations or excessive individualism. In Islam, it’s believed that there are countless ways to reach Allah, akin to the countless breaths we take.” (Voices from Maysan)
