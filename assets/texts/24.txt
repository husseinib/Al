<strong>‘Creative in everything’</strong><br>“They were creative in everything, not just in craftsmanship, blacksmithing, and carpentry; they were artists, scholars, and exceptionally intelligent poets. In the city where there were no televisions or entertainment venues, we would sit in cafes on the riverbank and play dominoes together, Muslims and Sabaeans, without discrimination. They were characterized by intelligence, wit, culture, and unwavering loyalty to their friends." (Voices from Amara)
