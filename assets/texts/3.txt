<strong>The City Mourned their Departure</strong><br>“My neighbours migrated to Turkey and informed me that they always fondly recalled us and our good moments. They would even send money to the neighbours and ask them to cook during our religious occasions, expressing their pride in the neighbourhood, the community, and the beliefs present in the city. …I am confident that they wish to return to their cities. Just as birds, no matter how far they migrate, return to their homelands, so do humans." (Voices from Amara)<br><strong>Sabian people I know</strong><br>“In the 1980s, many people left Baghdad. There was a man named Yahya and his wife, Fariha.<br>Yahya was blind, but he could still climb palm trees and trim them. It was a God-given talent.<br>He would climb the tree wearing his slippers.” (Voices from Amara)<br><strong>The honourable Sabians</strong><br>“Although their numbers are unfortunately declining, not as they used to be, they remain a significant and beloved majority in Iraq. They steadfastly adhere to their path of worship and devotion, making them an integral part of the noble community. It's impossible to fully comprehend the Sabians using populist concepts; they are a people deserving of respect. We share meals and drinks with them, embrace their customs, and they reciprocate with equal warmth. Any societal stereotypes about them are baseless. In Islam, we refer to them simply as the honourable Sabians. …Historical anecdotes indicate that certain Sabians observe fasting similar to Muslims. When questioned why, they respond it's a matter of brotherhood. …Presently, society is advancing and unifying. We once attended their festivities, and now I witness our community enthusiastically participating in their occasions. In their moments of sorrow, we share tea, just as it's served at our own gatherings of mourning. This is the essence of true brotherhood.” (Voices from Maysan).
