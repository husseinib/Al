<strong>Burial Traditions</strong><br>
“The Mandaean cemetery was located at the end of the Al-Zahra neighbourhood, separate from the Muslim and Jewish cemeteries. In the Mandaean faith, a funeral procession is not allowed to cross the river. Their burial customs were different from Muslims.” (Voices from Amara)
