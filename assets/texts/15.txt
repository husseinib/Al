<strong>Mandaean Crafts</strong><br>
“In the past, they had many shops in the market. They had two or three goldsmiths, carpenters for boats, metalworkers for plows, and stonemasons. The Sabian carpenters existed in those areas. Their main occupations were carpentry, metalworking, making sickles, and goldsmithing. They were known for goldsmithing, the Sabians were the goldsmiths and no one could match them in this craft. As for the Sabian carpenters, they worked in making bride chairs.” (Voices from Amara)

<strong>The Balam of the Mandaeans</strong><br>
“The Mandaeans are well-known for practicing crafts. The people in Maysan are well aware of this fact. For example, agricultural tools are items that deserve recognition in speech. One such tool is the 'saq,' which refers to a tool used for making a sickle. The sickle is an essential economic tool for agriculture; without a good sickle, the quality of the harvest may suffer. Crafts have contributed greatly throughout history. Among these crafts is the making of the 'balam,' a small boat. In the past, the 'balam' served as a means of transportation, carrying people and goods from one area to another. It facilitated merchants in reaching the marketplace and delivering fresh goods, known as 'taza' in the local vernacular. …Unfortunately, we still fail to give them the credit they deserve for their craftsmanship.” (Voices from Maysan)
